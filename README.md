Repository for Software Engineering Project 2019

The goal for this project was to build a math game for first and second graders that would be available online. A live version exists on AWS and can be accessed by redirect from www.mathteroids.com. We used Django for the back-end and Unity for the game development. The development for this project took place in three sprints that were planned and organized using Agile project management. After each sprint we presented the release that we had produced to the class.
